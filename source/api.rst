Application Programming Interface (API)
---------------------------------------

|geisa-api-hdr|

For GEISA applications to be interoperable across multiple hardware/device 
platforms, the GEISA specification establishes a well-defined set of APIs 
between the application and the device-specific portions of platform 
implementation.  
:doc:`/api/architecture` discusses the mechanics of the API.

The GEISA API offers the transaction sets for the following purposes:

- :doc:`/api/discovery`

    Provides the capabilities of the platform, including the device type and 
    capabilities (e.g. available sensors, actuators, interfaces, etc.)

- :doc:`/api/status`

    Provides the current status of the platform, including meter mode (normal, 
    test, alt), communications status, power status (powered, outage), and 
    resource availability.

- :doc:`/api/instantaneous`

    Provides streaming one second (or better) metrology data for applications 
    that need to continuously monitor conditions, without consuming and 
    analyzing waveform data directly.

- Billing Data

    Billing quantities generated by a meter register (e.g. kWh interval data, 
    peak demand, etc.).  These are the same values that a host meter would 
    typically share over a meter-to-cash protocol like ANSI C12.18/21/22 or 
    DLMS/COSEM.

- :doc:`/api/networking`

    Allows applications to communicate off-device either via messaging or 
    direct IP sockets.

- :doc:`/api/waveform`

    Allows applications to obtain the details on the waveform data frame 
    definition and to activate or deactivate waveform data streaming.

- Other Metering Data

    This includes pecialized metering quantities that meters may record and 
    that applications may request, but that are not so widely used as to be 
    included in the Instantaneous Data transaction definition.

- Actuator Status & Control

    Allows applications to query the status of actuators, such as a remote 
    disconnect switch, secondary contactor, and auxiliary relays, and, if 
    permitted by the application deployment manifest, control them.  

- :doc:`/api/sensors` 

    Exposes sensor data such as temperature, humidity, location, seismic data, 
    vibration, acceleration, and light / solar radiation.  These are examples 
    only; sensors are device/platform specific and other sensors may exist on
    a particular platform.

- Event Data

- System Messaging

.. note::

  Additional transaction sets may be added in future versions of the GEISA 
  specification.
